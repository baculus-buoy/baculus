Baculus is a template in how to build portable network provider that allows neighbors to communicate without any other infrastructure. It is a backpack with both local and long-range wifi, a solar/DC/AC chargeable battery, and a raspberry pi running an offline-first web application that syncs locally.

A simple build can run independent of power for up to 72 hours.

No node is special, and when any node goes down, a map alerts those nearby to ask them to move to a point where nodes can reconnect.

## baculus is

**self contained** - a literally transparent, waterproof backpack with room for people to modify to meet their own needs. All tools work fully on their own, with or without a larger network.

**resiliant** - the network asks humans for help repairing if a link goes down, by finding and directing where they should be placed.

**friendly** - the software design is minimal, allowing for communities to use in whatever way is most natural for themselves.

**a buoy?** - meant to be moveable by a single person when needed to fill gaps in network connectivity

## baculus helps

**communities define their own needs**, with a simple message board based on scuttlebutt

**repair infrastructure during disaster**, since disconnected nodes discover connected nodes and direct people where it should be setup

**answer who is where** when disaster strikes

**provide power and connectivity** to help coordinate when needed
